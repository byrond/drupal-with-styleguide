## The Grid (CSS Grids)

Our base project uses [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). We have also impelmented some best practice fallbacks for our basic grid setup. You should check [which browsers support CSS Grids](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) and the community-maintained list of [Grid Bugs](https://github.com/rachelandrew/gridbugs) to ensure you can use it with the included fallbacks on your project

Our base grid has a max-width of 1600px and is centered in the browser frame. Our base setup includes two example grid layouts setup on a two-column grid, a full-width grid item (`l-1up`), and a two column grid. Each has appropriate fallbacks. We recommend that you use CSS Grids for Grid layouts, and Flexbox as a supplement when appropriate. There are [plenty](https://hackernoon.com/the-ultimate-css-battle-grid-vs-flexbox-d40da0449faf) [of](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/best-practices-grid-layout/#grid-in-combination-with-other-layout-mechanisms) [blogs](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/03/30/should-i-use-grid-or-flexbox/) and [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs3piaN4b5I) on when to use Flexbox and when to use CSS Grid Layout.
