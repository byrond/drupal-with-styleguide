## Custom Sass Helpers

These files are included in the starterkit and allow you to set custom, project-wide sass. They include:

* `_init.scss`: Initializes your project by setting up all global variables such as font-size variables, font stacks, colors, and breakpoints. This also pulls in the node module sass we are using for breakpoint, normalize, and support-for.
* `_base.scss`: Used to set up base styles for type and links.
* `_animations.scss`: Stores a few basic animations. You should add all custom animations here.
* `_mixins.scss`: Sass mixins.
* `_print.scss`: Basic print styles.
* Vertical Rhythm (library): Vertical rhythm library is a set of mixins that help to manage spacing on the site consistently. This library is based on compass's vertical rhythm. You can learn more about the mixins from the [compass documentation](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/).
