## What is the Palantir Styleguide Starter Kit?

The Palantir Styleguide Starter Kit is a custom styleguide starterkit created to help standardize and streamline the styleguide creation process.

The staterkit includes some basic sass files, a grid skeleton, and some base components such as:

* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Links
* Inline Typographic elements
* Colors
* Base Grid
* Inline Images
* Inline Video
* Inline Blockquote
* Pagination

Additionally, [the Pantry](https://palantirnet.github.io/butler-pantry/) maintains other commonly used components that you might want to include in your project. You can reference the markup, styles, and js for those components to re-use in your own project.

The project uses `yarn` to manage packages and includes a few simple processes that can compile, watch, serve, and deploy your styleguide.
